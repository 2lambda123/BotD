# Browser support

The library supports all popular browsers.
We use the following command to determine which browsers to support:

```bash
npx browserslist "cover 96% in us, not IE < 11"
```

At the moment, these browsers are:

-   **Internet Explorer** 11 ([see the section below](#old-browsers-requirements))
-   **Edge** 93+
-   **Chrome** 49+
-   **Firefox** 52+
-   **Desktop Safari** 12.1+
-   **Mobile Safari** 10.3+
-   **Samsung Internet** 14.0+
-   **Android Browser** 4.4+ ([see the section below](#old-browsers-requirements))

Other browsers will probably also work, but we don't guarantee it.
